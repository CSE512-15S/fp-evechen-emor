				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>Research in education highlights the importance of exposing student data to teachers, who can use this information to provide students with timely and accurate assistance. As digital technologies become more commonly used in classrooms, we have an opportunity to collect and communicate student data to teachers in real-time. However, little research has explored how to effectively visualize student data for teachers during class. In this work, we partner with the non-profit company Enlearn to design real-time visualizations of student data collected through their tablet-based software. We characterize the domain problem, design appropriate data abstractions, and present two new visual encodings to support teacher tasks. Informal feedback suggests that our visualizations would be valuable for teachers, and we aim to formally study our designs with classroom teachers in the future.</p>

				<h4>Running Instructions</h4>
				<p>You can access our visualization online <a href='code/visualization.html'>here</a>.</p>
				<p>For optimal viewing, use a Chrome browser and a screen with resolution greater than or equal to 1280x800 so that the visualization fits onto a single screen without scrolling.</p>
				<p>Our visualization is built using D3 and Javascript. If you would like to run our visualization locally, please download the <i>code</i> folder in our repository. To view the visualization, run a local web server with <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code> and open localhost:8000/code/visualization.html.</p>
