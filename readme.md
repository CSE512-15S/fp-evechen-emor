## Breakdown of Work

Since we were preparing a paper for CSCW submission, the bulk of our project work began after Memorial Day.
Dates listed below are approximate.

- May 26: We meet to discuss and sketch layout ideas. 
- May 27-28: Yvonne creates rough mockups of our ideas while Nell pulls and cleans student data from Enlearn databases.
- May 29-Jun 7: We divide up work to create the main bulk of our visualization structure. 
- June 7-8: We create our poster, add animation transitions, and perform final cleanups on our visualization for the poster session.
- June 9-10: We divide the paper into sections we are each responsible for, create the final project webpage, and write this readme document.
