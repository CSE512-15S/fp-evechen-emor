## Final Project: Visualizing Student Problem-Solving Data

## Summary

We visualize student data collected by Enlearn, a non-profit organization that creates adaptive math curriculum for classroom use, delivered via tablet. 
Our visualization simulates a tool that enables teachers to monitor real time problem-solving progress of their students while using the Enlearn software.

## Development Process

Enlearn's software contains two pre-existing visualizations, which were evaluated in a one-week trial this spring. 

We first met with Enlearn staff to discuss feedback they had gathered from teachers about their visualizations. 

We then created some designs that would address teacher concerns and needs. During this process, we realized that a time invariant visualization would not demonstrate the full capabilities of our tool. We pulled student problem-solving data from Enlearn databases and used a playback slider encoding to simulate data streaming. 

Our design ideas led to two main visualizations in our tool. During the coding process, we realized that they required different data configurations, so we had to transform our data to fit these scenarios.


## Breakdown of Work

Since we were preparing a paper for CSCW submission, the bulk of our project work began after Memorial Day.
Dates listed below are approximate.

- May 26: We meet to discuss and sketch layout ideas. 
- May 27-28: Yvonne creates rough mockups of our ideas while Nell pulls and cleans student data from Enlearn databases.
- May 29-Jun 7: We divide up work to create the main bulk of our visualization structure. 
- June 7-8: We create our poster, add animation transitions, and perform final cleanups on our visualization for the poster session.
- June 9-10: We divide the paper into sections we are each responsible for, create the final project webpage, and write this readme document.
