In the present paper (as in ll) we investigate a channel model in which it is also possible to have failures of the form 0 A, 1> A, which are called deletions, and failures of the form A 0, A l, which are called insertions (here A is the empty word). For such channels, by analogy to the combinatorial problem of constructing optimal codes capable of correcting s reversals, we will consider the problem of constructing optimal codes capable of correcting deletions, insertions, and reversals.},
